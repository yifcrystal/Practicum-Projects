Fashom is an online clothing retailer that offers styling services for everyone —regardless of size, shape, or color. The organization's core mission is to promote body positivity, body confidence, and the idea that all bodies are equally valuable and deserving of respect. Fashom is currently at the strategic pivoting point where it hopes to transit from B2C to B2B, i.e. apart from selling clothing, it is moving into selling knowledge about clothing – in particular, Fashom looks forwards to launching apps on Shopify that other online retailers can use to boost value to their customers.

- Inventory Prediction
- Image Classfication 
Here are some demos of models we've been working on (were transformed based on original ones so not the original codes).
