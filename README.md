# Practicum-Projects

## Brief Introduction
We practicum team is working with an online clothing retailer that offers styling services for everyone —regardless of size, shape, or color. The organization's core mission is to promote body positivity, body confidence, and the idea that all bodies are equally valuable and deserving of respect. It is currently at the strategic pivoting point where it hopes to transit from B2C to B2B, i.e. apart from selling clothing, it is moving into selling knowledge about clothing – in particular, Fashom looks forwards to launching apps on Shopify that other online retailers can use to boost value to their customers. I've been project manager in the winter quarter to lead the team.

## Main Objectives 
There are three main algorithms that my team has been working on : 
- Recommendation Engine 
- Inventory Prediction
- Image Classfication  <br>
**Note : Here are some demos of models we've been working on (The codes shown here were transformed based on original ones so not the original codes and does not invovle any data from the company ). **
